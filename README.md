# Liquid Time-Constant LNN Implementation from scratch

This repository contains a an implementation Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTC-LNNs), as well as a comparable TCN, LSTM and transformer.

The implementation is based on the concept of Liquid Time-Constant Networks, which are a type of continuous-time recurrent neural network.

Various adversarial attacks and robustness certification experiments have been run on the models
